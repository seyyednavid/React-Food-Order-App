# React-Food-Order-App
create food order app with raect.

# Goals :
Design a food ordering app that enables users to select their desired dishes, add them to a cart, and provide their delivery address for order placement. Utilize a backend service like Firebase to manage orders seamlessly.

# ðŸ’¡I leveraged React's powerful hooks:
- useState: For handling component-level state, such as Cart items.
- useRef: Used for accessing and manipulating the DOM directly.
- useReducer: Simplified state management for complex app logic.
- useContext: Streamlined data sharing between components.

ðŸ’¡I also sent http requests using fetch, worked with forms and inputs and fetched data from the back-end using Firebase.
